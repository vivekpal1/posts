## Blinks 101: How They Work 🤓

1. **Solana Actions (The Engine):** Think of these as standardized APIs that your website or app can call to get blockchain stuff done.
2. **Blinks (The Trigger):** Special links that, when clicked, call a Solana Action and get things rolling.
3. **Wallets (The Executors):**  These guys (like Phantom or Solflare) handle signing and sending the transactions that Blinks create.

## Building Your Own Solana Actions: Let's Get Technical 🛠️

**1. Install the Tools:**

```bash
npm install @solana/actions @solana/web3.js
```

**2. Create Your Action Endpoints:**

```javascript
import { createAction } from '@solana/actions';
import { 
    Connection,
    PublicKey,
    SystemProgram,
    Transaction,
    LAMPORTS_PER_SOL,
} from '@solana/web3.js';

const connection = new Connection('https://api.devnet.solana.com');

// GET: Metadata Endpoint
createAction('/tip/:creator', (req, res) => {
    const creator = new PublicKey(req.params.creator);
    res.json({
        icon: 'https://yoursite.com/tip-jar.svg',
        title: 'Tip Creator',
        description: `Send a tip to ${creator.toString()}`,
        label: 'Tip Now',
        parameters: [{ name: 'amount', label: 'Amount (SOL)' }]
    });
});

// POST: Transaction Creation Endpoint
createAction('/tip/:creator', async (req, res) => {
    const creator = new PublicKey(req.params.creator);
    const amount = req.body.amount * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL;
    const sender = new PublicKey(req.body.account);

    const transaction = new Transaction().add(
        SystemProgram.transfer({
            fromPubkey: sender,
            toPubkey: creator,
            lamports: amount
        })
    );

    // ... Sign and serialize the transaction
    // ... Return the serialized transaction in the response
});
```
**3. Point the Way with `actions.json`:**

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "pathPattern": "/tip/:creator",
      "apiPath": "https://yoursite.com/api/tip/:creator"
    }
  ]
}
```
