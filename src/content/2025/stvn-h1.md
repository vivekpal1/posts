## The Catalyst Moment: New Leadership, New Vision

December 31, 2024 marked a turning point when Hieu (@0xk2_) became SuperteamVN lead, bringing a bold vision for 2025:

_"Attract top-tier talent & institutional partners into the Solana ecosystem. Empower members to succeed—from founders accessing capital & acceleration to individuals finding clear pathways. Grow beyond Hanoi & HCMC by establishing a Web3 building & living hub in Da Nang."_

This wasn't just leadership change, it was the beginning of Vietnam's Web3 transformation.

## Major Milestones: Building the Future

### The Da Nang Revolution

**March 1, 2025** - SuperteamVN partnered with NAPA Global to launch the **Da Nang Blockchain Hub**, the first dedicated Web3 space in central Vietnam. This 10th-floor workspace at 381 Tran Hung Dao became more than an office—it became the symbol of Vietnam's Web3 ambitions.

The timing was strategic. As Vietnam government began developing its national blockchain strategy, Da Nang positioned itself as the country's blockchain gateway and SuperteamVN was at the center of this transformation.

### Infrastructure Partnerships

**February 2025** - Strategic partnerships with DEPHY and Inferix GPU brought international DePIN projects to Vietnam, with SuperteamVN providing local expertise and community support.

**March 2025** - Launch of SEA DePIN Pioneers program with mentorship from industry leaders, accelerating Vietnam's position in decentralized infrastructure.

### Institutional Recognition

The breakthrough moment came when **Vikki Digital Bank**, one of Vietnam's rising fintech leaders, partnered with SuperteamVN for the Colosseum Breakout hackathon. This marked Vietnam's first major financial institution actively building on Solana—a signal that "institutions are here" wasn't just happening in the US, but in Vietnam too.
