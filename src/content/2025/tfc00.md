# A World of Tech, Tranquility, and Two Big Hurdles

## Introducing Thoughts from Cafes
I’m starting a new series called Thoughts from Cafes, a collection of stories and reflections born in the quiet corners of coffee shops, where the world slows down just enough for big ideas to take shape. Each piece will capture a moment, a view, a drink, a fleeting thought and weave it into my perspective on the tech landscape, my life as a Linux contributor and Web3 developer, and the dreams I’m chasing. Whether I’m sipping matcha by a lake or coding in a bustling city cafe, these posts will blend the serenity of those moments with the problems I’m itching to solve. This is the first, Thoughts from Cafes 00, written from a tranquil spot around the Son Tra Mountains, where nature and logic collide to spark something real.

## The Current Scene
I’m sitting in a small cafe tucked into the side of Son Tra Mountain, not quite on the slopes but close enough to feel the hills breathing. The air is cool, the lake beside me still, reflecting the last streaks of red in the clouds after sunset. It’s that fleeting hour when the sky isn’t dark yet, but the world feels hushed, like it’s whispering secrets. The cafe’s wooden tables are scattered with a few other souls, each lost in their own thoughts. My drink a blend of matcha and coconut, sits in front of me, its creamy green swirl a perfect metaphor for the mix of calm and chaos in my head. The redness in the clouds urges me to write stories, to capture this moment in words. But my nerdy, logical mind, honed by years of Linux kernel patches and Solana blockchain tinkering, pulls me toward problems to solve, systems to build. This article is the result of that tug-of-war, a story about the tech world I see in 2025 and two challenges that keep me up at night: bandwidth and operating systems.

## The Tech Landscape in 2025
It’s May 2025, and the tech world feels like it’s on the edge of something massive. I see it every day in the code I write, the projects I dream up. Blockchain platforms like Solana are screaming fast, processing thousands of transactions per second, powering everything from digital art markets to instant payment systems. I’ve worked on Solana myself, building tools like Wind Network to index its data, and I can tell you it’s a beast with huge Market value. But it’s not the “world computer” we hoped for, not yet. It’s a piece of the puzzle, not the whole picture.

Then there’s AI, which is everywhere. From chatbots that sound eerily human to algorithms coding for me,  predicting everything from stock prices to natural disasters, it’s reshaping how we work and live. Researchers say we’re a few years from machines that can think like us - real general intelligence. Quantum computing is creeping closer too, with chips that use subatomic particles to crunch numbers at speeds we can barely imagine. Photonic chips, which use light instead of electricity, are starting to show up in labs, promising to make our systems faster and cheaper. And don’t get me started on human longevity, scientists are tweaking genes to keep us healthier longer, with billions poured into research that could add years to our lives.

It’s a thrilling time, like standing on a cliff watching a storm roll in. But as I sip my matcha-coconut drink, staring at the lake, I can’t shake the feeling that we’re tripping over two big hurdles that could slow us down: the internet we rely on and the computers we use every day.

## Bandwidth, the Silent Bottleneck
The first problem is bandwidth. We’ve been promised blazing-fast internet for years - 5G, gigabit speeds, the works. But here in 2025, the reality is messier. In some parts of the world, like Northern Europe, you can download a movie in seconds. But in places like countryside or rural India, you’re lucky to get 4 Mbps, barely enough for a video call. I’ve seen it myself, traveling through Southeast Asia, where a cafe’s Wi-Fi crawls while I’m trying to sync with some servers or nodes. How are we supposed to build a global, decentralized network, a true world computer, if half the world is stuck on dial-up speeds?
This isn’t just about downloading games or streaming shows. Slow internet strangles innovation. Imagine trying to run a powerful AI model in the cloud or query a blockchain for real-time data when your connection drops every five minutes. Internet providers are too busy sending bills to invest in the infrastructure we need. My work on Wind Network, which indexes Solana’s data for developers, relies on fast, reliable connections. Without better bandwidth, we’re building castles on sand. Sitting here by the lake, watching the clouds fade, I wonder how we’ll connect the world if we can’t even connect our devices.

## Operating Systems, Stuck in the Past
The second hurdle is closer to home for me: our computers. I’ve spent years contributing to Linux, tweaking kernels, and building ShastraOS, a decentralized OS I started in high school. But most people are still using Windows or macOS, systems that haven’t changed much in decades. Windows has 72% of the market, macOS maybe 15%, and they’re fine for emails or gaming, but they’re not built for the future we’re heading toward. 
Imagine a world where your computer isn’t just a box on your desk but a gateway to a global network, running AI models, blockchain apps, and virtual machines, all securely and remotely. That’s what I tried to build with ShastraOS, a lightweight, Web3-ready OS that could talk to Solana, store data on Filecoin, and let you join a decentralized internet. It’s on pause now, short on funds, but the dream lives on. Our current operating systems are like old cars chugging along on a highway built for spaceships. We need something new, something that matches the speed of Solana, the smarts of AI, the potential of quantum chips. As the last light fades over Son Tra, I’m sketching ideas for a system that could tie it all together, a digital bridge between today’s tech and tomorrow’s possibilities.

#### Oh My Matcha-Coconut Mocktail!
It’s like the balance I’m chasing: the part of me that wants to write stories, to capture the red clouds and the stillness, and the part that’s always solving, always building. The clouds tell me to dream big, to imagine a world where tech lifts everyone up. My logical mind says, “Fix the bandwidth. Rethink the OS.” Together, they make this moment, this article, this series.
I’m not here to sell you a shiny future or pretend I have all the answers. But as I sit here, watching the lake ripple, I know we’re close to something incredible if we can solve these two problems. Bandwidth to connect us, and operating systems to free us. That’s the tech landscape I see, and it’s what I’ll keep exploring, one cafe at a time.

## What’s Next
Thoughts from Cafes 01 is coming soon, probably from another corner of the world, with another drink and another big idea. Maybe I’ll dive deeper into how we fix the internet or sketch out what a new OS could look like. For now, I’m finishing my matcha-coconut, watching the sky turn dark, and thinking about the next line of code for wIndexer, the next hill to climb. If you’re reading this, join me—let’s talk Solana, decentralization, or just the beauty of a sunset. What’s holding us back, and how do we break free?
