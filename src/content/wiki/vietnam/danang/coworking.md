## 🌟 The Best Spots (Ranked by Value)

### 💎 **Hana's Coworking Space** - *The Community Hub*
**📍** [42 Đ. Ng. Thì Sĩ, Bắc Mỹ An, Ngũ Hành Sơn](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BPZcmTtT1MyBvX7F6)  
**💰** 100,000 VND/day | **⏰** 6am - 6pm  
**📞** 0972490977 | **🌐** [hanacoworkingdanang.com](https://www.hanacoworkingdanang.com/)

> *This place isn't just about desks and WiFi - it's about building connections.*

**Why I keep coming back:**
- **Insane internet speeds** - I've clocked over 800mbps here (no joke!)
- **Hana herself** is a gem - always ready to help and genuinely cares about the community
- **Unbeatable value** at 100k VND for unlimited day access
- **Free monitors and PC** access when you need that extra screen real estate
- **Beach proximity** - 5-minute walk to the coast for those afternoon decompression walks

**The catch:** Early closing at 6pm, so not great for night owls

### 🏢 **Synergy Studio Han River** - *The Professional*
**📍** [21 Hà Thị Thân, An Hải Trung, Sơn Trà](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BPZcmTtT1MyBvX7F6)  
**💰** 200,000 VND/day (monthly packages available)  
**📞** +840559116999 | **🌐** [synergy.vn](https://synergy.vn/)

**The experience:**
Those **ergonomic chairs** are a back-saver during marathon coding sessions. The 150mbps+ internet never lets you down, and borrowing a 24-inch monitor is as easy as asking nicely.

**Location perks:**
- 2-minute stroll to Han River and Dragon Bridge
- Perfect for those Instagram-worthy sunset breaks
- Surrounded by good lunch options

**Budget reality check:** More expensive than other options, but the monthly packages make it worthwhile if you're staying long-term.

### 🌿 **Coworking Danang** - *The 24/7 Garden Oasis*
**📍** [28 Trần Văn Thành, Khuê Mỹ, Ngũ Hành Sơn](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BPZcmTtT1MyBvX7F6)  
**💰** Flexible pricing | **⏰** 24/7  
**📞** 0868364415

**What makes it special:**
This place gets the variety thing right. Whether you need:
- ❄️ **AC room** for those sweltering summer afternoons
- 🎯 **Focus room** when you need to eliminate all distractions
- 🌿 **Garden workspace** with actual baby fish (seriously, it's therapeutic)
- 🏖️ **3-minute walk to My Khe Beach** for quick surf checks

**Night owl friendly:** Being 24/7 makes this perfect for those late-night coding sprints or early morning calls with clients back home.

### ☕ **OneSip Café & Co-Working Space** - *The Cozy Corner*
**📍** [5 Đ. An Mỹ, An Hải, Sơn Trà](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BPZcmTtT1MyBvX7F6)  
**⏰** Until 5:30pm | **📞** 0965754901  
**📘** [Facebook](https://facebook.com/onesipcafe)

**The vibe:**
Cute coffee shop that happens to be perfect for work. Their **matcha is legitimately good** (not the powdered stuff), and there's even a friendly dog that might become your coding buddy.

**Best for:**
- Morning/afternoon work sessions
- Getting away from busy street noise
- When you want that café atmosphere without the chaos

**Heads up:** Early closing time - plan accordingly!

---

### 🌊 **Seaview Coworking Space** - *The Speedster*
**📍** [32 Hà Chương, Phước Mỹ, Sơn Trà](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BPZcmTtT1MyBvX7F6)  
**📞** 0905811009 | **🌐** [seaviewcoworkingdanang.com](https://seaviewcoworkingdanang.com/)

**Internet obsessed?** This is your place. I consistently get 300mbps+ here, and the staff genuinely cares about your experience.

**Simple but effective:** No fancy amenities, but solid fundamentals - fast WiFi, comfortable seating, and people who actually want to help.

---

### 📚 **Harvard Cave Café** - *The Café Worker*
**📍** [209/21 Nguyễn Văn Thoại, An Hải, Ngũ Hành Sơn](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BPZcmTtT1MyBvX7F6)  
**📞** 0773511573

**Perfect for:** Quick coffee + work sessions. Grab their **café đá** (Vietnamese iced coffee) and knock out a few hours of focused work. Nothing fancy, just reliable.

---

### 🏗️ **cirCO Da Nang City Centre** - *The Fancy One*
**📍** [17 Quang Trung, Hải Châu 1, Hải Châu](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BPZcmTtT1MyBvX7F6)  
**💰** Premium pricing | **⏰** 24/7  
**📞** 02369997779 | **🌐** [circo.co](https://circo.co/)

**The 30th floor experience:**
Stunning city views, luxurious space, right next to Software Park 1. But here's the thing - it's more suited for:
- 🎪 **Events and meetings**
- 🏢 **Long-term office rentals**  
- 📸 **Impressive client calls**

**Reality check:** Great for occasional use or impressing clients, but probably overkill for daily grinding.

## 💡 Pro Tips from Someone Who's Been There

1. **Always test the WiFi first** - ask for the password and run a speed test before committing to a full day
2. **Bring a portable charger** - not all spaces have outlets at every seat
3. **Download offline maps** - some places are tucked away in alleys
4. **Cash is king** - most places prefer VND over cards
5. **Peak hours are 9am-11am and 2pm-4pm** - arrive early for the best seats
