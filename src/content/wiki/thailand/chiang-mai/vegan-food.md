## Understanding Jay Food vs Western Veganism

### What is Jay Food? üü°

**Jay (‡πÄ‡∏à) food** represents traditional Buddhist-Taoist dietary practice that excludes:
- All animal products
- "Pungent" vegetables: garlic, onions, chives, shallots, leeks
- Often alcohol and strong spices

**Identification:** Look for yellow flags with red Thai text (‡πÄ‡∏à)

### Jay vs Western Vegan

| Aspect | Jay Food | Western Vegan |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| **Price** | 30-80 THB | 100-400 THB |
| **Flavor** | Mild, Buddhist-influenced | Full spectrum of seasonings |
| **Availability** | Widespread, especially temples | Tourist areas, specific restaurants |
| **Cultural Experience** | Authentic Thai Buddhism | Familiar to Western palates |

**Pro Tip:** Try both styles - jay food for authentic cultural immersion and budget meals, Western vegan for familiar flavors and social dining.
